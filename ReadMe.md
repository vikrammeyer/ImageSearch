# Image Search
This fullstack project has a frontend and a backend that serve the purpose of uploading and downloading images from a server while at the same time providing image search functionality.

Images are stored on the disk and a MySQL database stores the path to the images and the feature vector that describes the images and is used to determine how similar images are to each other. A command line interface built with argparse is used to setup the database and search for similar images.
